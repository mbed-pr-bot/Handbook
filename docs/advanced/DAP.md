# DAPLink

DAPlink is an open source project that implements the embedded firmware required for a Cortex debug probe. The project is hosted on GitHub and is published under an Apache 2.0 license, making it attractive for commercial developments.

The software project is complemented by a series of reference designs for creating the DAPLink debug probe hardware, which is available [here](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-hardware-development-kit/en/latest/).

## DAPLink features

A DAPLink debug probe connects to your host computer through USB and connects to your target system (the one to be programmed and debugged) through a standard [Cortex debug connector](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.faqs/attached/13634/cortex_debug_connectors.pdf). It provides three main features - all over a single USB connection.

### HID interface 

The driver-less HID interface provides a channel over which the CMSIS-DAP debug protocol runs. This enables all the leading industry standard toolchains to program and debug the target system. 

Supported tools include:

  * Keil MDK.
  * IAR Workbench.
  * pyOCD.

### USB disk drag and drop programming 

DAPLink debug probes appear on the host computer as a USB disk. Program files in binary (``.bin``) and hex (``.hex``) formats can be copied onto the USB disk, which then programs them into the memory of the target system.

<span class="notes">**Note:** The DAPLink probe needs to contain the programming algorithms specific to the target system. Therefore, the version of the DAPLink firmware you use must match the target system.</span>

## USB serial port 

The DAPLink debug probe also provides a USB serial port, which can be bridged through to a TTL UART on the target system.
The USB serial port will appear on a Windows machine as a COM port, or on a Linux machine as a /dev/tty interface.

For more information on configuring your host computer to use this feature, please [see here](../getting_started/serial_communication.md).
