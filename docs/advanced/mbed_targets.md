# Adding and configuring mbed targets

mbed uses JSON as a description language for its build targets. The JSON description of mbed targets can be found in `targets/targets.json`. To better understand how a target is defined, we'll use this example (taken from `targets.json`):

```
    "TEENSY3_1": {
        "inherits": ["Target"],
        "core": "Cortex-M4",
        "extra_labels": ["Freescale", "K20XX", "K20DX256"],
        "OUTPUT_EXT": "hex",
        "is_disk_virtual": true,
        "supported_toolchains": ["GCC_ARM", "ARM"],
        "post_binary_hook": {
            "function": "TEENSY3_1Code.binary_hook",
            "toolchains": ["ARM_STD", "ARM_MICRO", "GCC_ARM"]
        },
        "device_name": "MK20DX256xxx7",
        "detect_code": ["0230"]
```

The style that we use for targets is:
 - Each property is on its own line.
 - The open brace `{` is on the same line as the target name, or the property name that is its key.
 - The close brace `}` or close brace and comma `},` are on their own line.
 - Lists take up at most one line.
 - Long lines are not split.

# Standard properties

This section lists all the properties the mbed build system understands. Unless specified otherwise, all properties are optional.

## `inherits`

The description of an mbed target can "inherit" from one or more descriptions of other targets. When a target, called a _child_ inherits from another target, called its _parent_, the child automatically copies all the properties from the parent. After the child has copied the properties of the parent, it may then overwrite, add or remove from those properties. In our example above, `TEENSY3_1` inherits from `Target`. This is the definition of `Target`:

```
"Target": {
    "core": null,
    "default_toolchain": "ARM",
    "supported_toolchains": null,
    "extra_labels": [],
    "is_disk_virtual": false,
    "macros": [],
    "detect_code": [],
    "public": false
}
```

Because `TEENSY3_1` inherits from `Target`:

- `core` is a property defined both in `TEENSY3_1` and `Target`. Because `TEENSY3_1` overwrites it, the value of `core` for `TEENSY3_1` is `Cortex-M4`.
- `default_toolchain` is not defined in `TEENSY3_1`. `TEENSY3_1` copies the definition of `default_toolchain` from `Target`, so the value of `default_toolchain` for `TEENSY3_1` is `ARM`.

A child target may add properties that don't exist in any of its parents. For example, `OUTPUT_EXT` is defined in `TEENSY3_1` but is not defined in `Target`.

It's possible, but discouraged, to inherit from more than one target. For example:

```
"ImaginaryTarget": {
    "inherits": ["Target", "TEENSY3_1"]
}
```

In this case, `ImaginaryTarget` inherits the properties of both `Target` and `TEENSY3_1`, so:

- The value of `ImaginaryTarget.default_toolchain` is `ARM` from `Target`.
- The value of `ImaginaryTarget.OUTPUT_EXT` is `hex` from `TEENSY3_1`.
- The value of `ImaginaryTarget.core` is `null` from `Target` because that's the first parent of `ImaginaryTarget` that defines `core`.

Avoid using multiple inheritance for your targets. If you use multiple inheritance, keep in mind that target description is similar to the Python class inheritance mechanism prior to version 2.3. The target description inheritance checks for descriptions in this order:

1. Look for the property in the current target.
1. If not found, look for the property in the first target's parent, then in the parent of the parent and so on.
1. If not found, look for the property in the rest of the target's parents, relative to the current inheritance level.

For more details about the Python method resolution order, check [this link](http://makina-corpus.com/blog/metier/2014/python-tutorial-understanding-python-mro-class-search-path).

## `core`

The name of the target's ARM core.

Possible values: `"Cortex-M0"`, `"Cortex-M0+"`, `"Cortex-M1"`, `"Cortex-M3"`, `"Cortex-M4"`, `"Cortex-M4F"`, `"Cortex-M7"`, `"Cortex-M7F"`, `"Cortex-A9"`

## `public`

The `public` property controls which targets the mbed build system allows users to build. You may define targets as parents for other targets. When you define such a target, its description must set the `public` property to `false`. `Target`, shown above, sets `public` to `false` for this reason.

If `public` is not defined for a target, it defaults to `true`.

<span class="notes">**Note:** Unlike other target properties, **the value of `public` is not inherited from a parent to its children**.</span>

## `macros`, `macros_add` and `macros_remove`

The `macros` property defines a list of macros that are available when compiling code. You may define these macros with or without a value. For example, the declaration `"macros": ["NO_VALUE", "VALUE=10"]` will add `-DNO_VALUE -DVALUE=10` to the compiler's command-line.

When a target inherits, it's possible to alter the values of `macros` in the child targets without redefining `macros` completely using `macros_add` and `macros_remove`. A child target may use `macros_add` to add its own macros and `macros_remove` to remove macros defined by its parents.

For example:

```
    "TargetA": {
        "macros": ["PARENT_MACRO1", "PARENT_MACRO2"]
    },
    "TargetB": {
        "inherits": ["TargetA"],
        "macros_add": ["CHILD_MACRO1"],
        "macros_remove": ["PARENT_MACRO2"]
    }
```

In this configuration, the value of `TargetB.macros` is `["PARENT_MACRO1", "CHILD_MACRO1"]`.

## `extra_labels`, `extra_labels_add` and `extra_labels_remove`

The list of _labels_ defines how the build system looks for sources, include directories and so on. `extra_labels` makes the build system aware of additional directories that it must scan for such files.

When you use target inheritance, you may alter the values of `extra_labels` using `extra_labels_add` and `extra_labels_remove`. This is similar to the `macros_add` and `macros_remove` mechanism described in the previous section.

## `features`, `features_add` and `features_remove`

The list of _features_ enables software features on a platform. Like `extra_labels`, `features` makes the build system aware of additional directories it must scan for resources.

When you use target inheritance, you may alter the values of `features` using `features_add` and `features_remove`. This is similar to the `macros_add` and `macros_remove` mechanism the previous section describes.

## `device_has`

The list in `device_has` defines what hardware a device has.

mbed, libraries and application source code can then select different implementations of drivers based on hardware availability; selectively compile drivers for existing hardware only; or run only the tests that apply to a particular platform. The values in `device_has` are available in C, C++ and assembly language as `DEVICE_` prefixed macros.

## `supported_toolchains`

The `supported_toolchains` property is the list of toolchains that support a target. The allowed values for `supported_toolchains` are `ARM`, `uARM`, `GCC_ARM` and `IAR`.

## `default_toolchain`

The `default_toolchain` property names the toolchain that compiles code for this target in the Online Compiler. Possible values for `default_toolchain` are `ARM` or `uARM`.

## `post_binary_hook`

Some targets require specific actions to generate a programmable binary image. Specify these actions using the `post_binary_hook` property and custom Python code. The value of `post_binary_hook` must be a JSON object with keys `function` and optionally `toolchain`. Within the `post_binary_hook` JSON object, the `function` key must contain a Python function that is accessible from the namespace of `tools/targets/__init__.py`, and the optional `toolchain` key must contain a list of toolchains that require processing from the `post_binary_hook`. When you do not specify the `toolchains` key for a `post_binary_hook`, you can assume the `post_binary_hook` applies to all toolcahins. For the `TEENSY3_1` target above, the definition of `post_binary_hook` looks like this:

```
"post_binary_hook": {
    "function": "TEENSY3_1Code.binary_hook",
    "toolchains": ["ARM_STD", "ARM_MICRO", "GCC_ARM"]
}
```

After the generation of an initial binary image for the `TEENSY3_1`, the build system calls the function `binary_hook` in the `TEENSY3_1Code` class within `tools/targets/__init__.py`. 

The build tools call `TEENSY3_1` `post_binary_hook` when they build using the `ARM_STD`, `ARM_MICRO` or `GCC_ARM` toolchain.

As for the `TEENSY3_1` code, this is how it looks in `tools/targets/__init__.py`:

```
class TEENSY3_1Code:
    @staticmethod
    def binary_hook(t_self, resources, elf, binf):
        from intelhex import IntelHex
        binh = IntelHex()
        binh.loadbin(binf, offset = 0)

        with open(binf.replace(".bin", ".hex"), "w") as f:
            binh.tofile(f, format='hex')
```

The `post_build_hook` for the `TEENSY3_1` converts the output file (`binf`) from binary format to Intel HEX format. See the other hooks in `tools/targets/__init__.py` for more examples of hook code. 

## `device_name`

Use this property to pass necessary data for exporting to various third party tools and IDEs and for building applications with bootloaders.

Please see [exporters.md](exporters.md) for information about this field.

## `OUTPUT_EXT`

The `OUTPUT_EXT` property controls the file type emitted for a target by the build system. You may set `OUTPUT_EXT` to `bin` for binary format, `hex` for Intel HEX format and `elf` for ELF format. We discourage using the `elf` value for `OUTPUT_EXT` because the build system must always emit an ELF file. 

## `default_lib`

The `delault_lib` property controls which library, small or standard, the `GCC_ARM` toolchain links. The `default_lib` property may take on the values `std` for the standard library and `small` for the reduced size library.

## `bootloader_supported`

The `bootloader_supported` property controls whether the build system allows a bootloader or a bootloader-using application to be built for a target. The default value of `bootloader_supported` is `false`.

## `release_versions`

The `release_versions` property is a list of major versions of mbed OS that the target supports. The list within `release_versions` may only contain `2`, indicating that the support of mbed OS 2, and `5`, indicating the support of mbed OS 5. We build all targets that are released for mbed OS 2 as a static library. Targets are released for mbed OS 2 by putting a `2` in the `release_version` list.

## `supported_form_factors`

The `supported_form_factors` property is an optional list of form factors that a development board supports. You can use this property in C, C++ and assembly language by passing a macro prefixed with `TARGET_FF_` to the compiler. The accepted values for `supported_form_factors` are `ARDUINO`, which indicates compatibility with Arduino headers, and `MORPHO`, which indicates compatibility with ST Morpho headers.
