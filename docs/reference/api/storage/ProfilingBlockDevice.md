## ProfilingBlockDevice

The ProfilingBlockDevice class provides a decorator for an existing block device object to log reads, writes and erases.

ProfilingBlockDevices take in a pointer to the block device being profiled as the only configurable parameter. If you want to count a storage operation such as programming, reading or writing to a block device, you should use the ProfilingBlockDevice object as the interface to the storage block rather than the underlying device. The below example highlights this use case.
