## RtosTimer

<span class="warnings">**Deprecated**: The EventQueue has superseded the RtosTimer. The RtosTimer and EventQueue duplicate the functionality of timing events outside of interrupt context; however, the EventQueue has additional features to handle deferring other events to multiple contexts.</span>

Use the RtosTimer class to create and control timer functions in the system. A timer function is called when a time period expires, so both one-shot and periodic timers are possible. You can start, restart or stop a timer.

The thread `osTimerThread` handles timers. Callback functions run under the control of this thread and may use CMSIS-RTOS API calls.
