## iBeacon

iBeacon is an Apple technology based on BLE that you can use as an indoor positioning system. It allows iOS apps to track if the user enters a specific region and offers actions and notification aware of the user context.

The iBeacon class builds an advertising payload mimicking an iBeacon and assigns it to a given BLE interface.

<span class="warnings"> **Warning:** If you are interested in manufacturing iBeacons, you must obtain a license from Apple. For more information, please see <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/" target="_blank">Apple's website</a>. The licence also grants access to the iBeacon's technical specification.</span>
