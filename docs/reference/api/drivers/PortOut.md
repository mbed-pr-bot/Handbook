## PortOut

Use the PortOut interface to write to an underlying GPIO port as one value. This is much faster than <a href="/docs/v5.6/reference/busout.html" target="_blank">BusOut</a> because you can write a port in one go, but it is much less flexible because you are constrained by the port and bit layout of the underlying GPIO ports.

A mask can be supplied so only certain bits of a port are used, allowing other bits to be used for other interfaces.
