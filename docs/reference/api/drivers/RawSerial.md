## RawSerial

The RawSerial class provides UART functionality without the use of Stream's print and scan functions the way the Serial class does. RawSerial does not retarget the standard library print and scan functions. Instead, RawSerial reimplements the print and scan functions to use each target's underlying serial communication functions. See the porting guide for <a href="/docs/v5.6/reference/contributing-target.html#serial" target="_blank">target serial support</a>. This makes RawSerial suitable for use in interrupt handlers with the RTOS.

Serial channels have the following configurable parameters in the constructor:

  - _Tx and Rx Pin_ - The physical serial transmit and receive pins. You can specify a Tx or Tx pin as Not Connected (NC) to get Simplex communication, or specify both to get full duplex.
  - _Baud Rate_ - This setting is an optional constructor parameter. Standard baud rates range from a few hundred bits per second to megabits per second. The default setting for a serial connection on the Mbed microcontroller is 9600 baud. This setting may also be configured at run time.

The following parameters can be configured at runtime in the RawSerial object. You can view more information about the configurable settings and functions in the class reference.

  - _Baud Rate_ - Standard baud rates range from a few hundred bits per second to megabits per second. The default setting for a serial connection on the Mbed microcontroller is 9600 baud.
  - _Data length_ - Transferred data can be either 7 or 8 bits long. The default setting for a serial connection on the Mbed microcontroller is 8 bits.
  - _Parity_ - You can add an optional parity bit. The object automatically sets the parity bit to make the number of 1s in the data either odd or even. Parity settings are *Odd*, *Even* or *None*. The default setting for a serial connection on the Arm Mbed microcontroller is None.
  - _Stop Bits_ - After the transmission of data and parity bits, the RawSerial object inserts one or two stop bits to "frame" the data. The default setting for a serial connection on the Mbed microcontroller is one stop bit.

_9600-8-N-1_, a  common notation for serial port settings, describes the default settings for the Mbed microcontroller.

#### Mbed OS example

Common use cases for RawSerial are IRQ heavy UART operations, such as the <a href="https://github.com/ARMmbed/ATParser/blob/3209400df676cbf0183a5894f648c71727602d30/BufferedSerial/BufferedSerial.cpp#L29" target="_blank">ATParser</a> in the ESP8266 driver. This driver uses UART on user supplied pins to communicate with the offchip ESP8266 module.
