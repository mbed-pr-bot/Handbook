# Writing applications with the mbed OS APIs

mbed OS lets you write applications that run on embedded devices, by providing the layer that interprets your application's code in a way the hardware can understand.

Your application code - written in C++ - uses the application programing interfaces (APIs) presented by mbed OS to receive information from the hardware and send instructions to it. This means that a lot of the challenges in getting started with microcontrollers or integrating large amounts of software is already taken care of.

The full API references are [here](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os-api-reference/).

You can see how we use the API in our sample applications:
