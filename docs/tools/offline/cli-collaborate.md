### Importing an existing program

Use `mbed import` to clone an existing program and all its dependencies to your machine:

```
$ mbed import https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-example-blinky
[mbed] Importing program "mbed-os-example-blinky" from "https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-example-blinky" at latest revision in the current branch
[mbed] Adding library "mbed-os" from "https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os" at rev #dd36dc4228b5
$ cd mbed-os-example-blinky
```

Mbed CLI also supports programs based on Mbed OS 2, which it automatically detects and which do not require additional options:

```
$ mbed import https://mbed.org/teams/mbed/code/mbed_blinky/
[mbed] Importing program "mbed_blinky" from "https://mbed.org/teams/mbed/code/mbed_blinky" at latest revision in the current branch
[mbed] Adding library "mbed" from "http://mbed.org/users/mbed_official/code/mbed/builds" at rev #f9eeca106725
[mbed] Couldn't find build tools in your program. Downloading the mbed 2.0 SDK tools...
$ cd mbed-os-example-blinky
```

You can use the "import" command without specifying a full URL; Mbed CLI adds a <a href="https://github.com/ARMmbed" target="_blank">prefix</a> to the URL if one is not present. For example, this command:

```
$ mbed import mbed-os-example-blinky
```

is equivalent to this command:

```
$ mbed import https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-example-blinky
```

### Importing from a Git or GitHub clone

If you have manually cloned a Git repository into your workspace and you want to add all missing libraries, then you can use the `deploy` command:

```
$ mbed deploy
[mbed] Adding library "mbed-os" from "https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os" at rev #dd36dc4228b5
```

Don't forget to set the current directory as the root of your program:

```
$ mbed new .
```

### Adding and removing libraries

While working on your code, you may need to add another library to your application or remove existing libraries.

Adding a new library to your program is not the same as cloning the repository. Don't clone a library using `hg` or `git`; use `mbed add` to add the library. This ensures that all libraries and sublibraries are populated as well.

Removing a library from your program is not the same as deleting the library directory. Mbed CLI updates and removes library reference files. Use `mbed remove` to remove the library; don't remove its directory with `rm`.

#### Adding a library

Use `mbed add` to add the latest revision of a library:

```
$ mbed add https://developer.mbed.org/users/wim/code/TextLCD/
```

Use the `URL#hash` format to add a library from a URL at a specific revision hash:

```
$ mbed add https://developer.mbed.org/users/wim/code/TextLCD/#e5a0dcb43ecc
```

#### Specifying a destination directory

If you want to specify a directory to which to add your library, you can give an additional argument to ``add``, which names that directory. For example, If you'd rather add the previous library in a directory called "text-lcd" (instead of TextLCD):

```
$ mbed add https://developer.mbed.org/users/wim/code/TextLCD/ text-lcd
```

Although Mbed CLI supports this functionality, we don't encourage it. Adding a library with a name that differs from its source repository can lead to confusion.

#### Removing a library

If at any point you decide that you don't need a library any more, you can use `mbed remove` with the path of the library:

```
$ mbed remove text-lcd
```

### Exporting to desktop IDEs

If you need to debug your code, you can export your source tree to an IDE project file to use the IDE's debugging facilities. Mbed CLI supports exporting to Keil uVision, IAR Workbench, a Makefile using GCC Arm, Eclipse using GCC Arm and other IDEs.

For example, to export to uVision, run:

```
$ mbed export -i uvision -m K64F
```

Mbed CLI creates a `.uvprojx` file in the projectfiles/uvision folder. You can open the project file with uVision.

### Publishing changes

#### Checking status

As you develop your program, you'll edit parts of it. You can get the status of all the repositories in your program (recursively) by running `mbed status`. If a repository has uncommitted changes, this command displays these changes.

Here's an example:

```
[mbed] Status for "mbed-os-program":
 M main.cpp
 M mbed-os.lib
?? gdb_log.txt
?? test_spec.json

[mbed] Status for "mbed-os":
 M tools/toolchains/arm.py
 M tools/toolchains/gcc.py

[mbed] Status for "mbed-client-classic":
 M source/m2mtimerpimpl.cpp

[mbed] Status for "mbed-mesh-api":
 M source/include/static_config.h
```

You can then commit or discard these changes through that repository's version control system.

#### Pushing upstream

To push the changes in your local tree upstream, run `mbed publish`. `mbed publish` works recursively, pushing the leaf dependencies first, then updating the dependents and pushing them too.

Let's assume that the list of dependencies of your program (obtained by running `mbed ls`) looks like this:

```
my-mbed-os-example (a5ac4bf2e468)
|- mbed-os (5fea6e69ec1a)
`- my-libs (e39199afa2da)
   |- my-libs/iot-client (571cfef17dd0)
   `- my-libs/test-framework (cd18b5a50df4)
```

Let's assume that you make changes to `iot-client`. `mbed publish` detects the change on the leaf `iot-client` dependency and asks you to commit it. Then `mbed publish` detects that `my-libs` depends on `iot-client`, updates the `my-libs` dependency on `iot-client` to its latest version by updating the `iot-client.lib` file and asks you to commit it. This propagates up to `my-libs` and finally to your program, `my-mbed-os-example`.

#### Publishing a local program or library

When you create a new (local) version control managed program or library, its revision history exists only locally. The repository is not associated with the remote one. To publish the local repository, please follow these steps:

1. Create a new empty repository on the remote site. This can be on a public repository hosting service (GitHub, Bitbucket, mbed.org), your own service or a different location on your system.
1. Copy the URL/location of the new repository in your clipboard.
1. Open command-line in the local repository directory (for example, change directory to `mbed-os-example/local-lib`).
1. To associate the local repository:
 * For Git, run `git remote add origin <url-or-path-to-your-remote-repo>`.
 * For Mercurial, edit .hg/hgrc and add (or replace if exists):

            ```
            [paths]
            default = <url-or-path-to-your-remote-repo>
            ```

1. Run `mbed publish` to publish your changes.

In a scenario with nested local repositories, start with the leaf repositories first.

### The forking workflow

Git enables a workflow where the publish/push repository may be different than the original ("origin") one. This allows new revisions in a fork repository while maintaining an association with the original repository. To use this workflow, first import an Mbed OS program or Mbed OS itself, and then associate the push remote with your fork. For example:

```
$ git remote set-url --push origin https://github.com/screamerbg/repo-fork
```

Both `git commit & git push` and `mbed publish` push the new revisions to your fork. You can fetch from the original repository using `mbed update` or `git pull`. If you explicitly want to fetch or pull from your fork, then you can use `git pull https://github.com/screamerbg/repo-fork [branch]`.

Through the workflow explained above, Mbed CLI maintains association to the original repository (which you may want to send a pull request to) and records references with the revision hashes that you push to your fork. Until your pull request (PR) is accepted, all recorded references are invalid. Once the PR is accepted, all revision hashes from your fork become part the original repository, making them valid.
