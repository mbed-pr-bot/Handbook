## Creating and using a bootloader

This guide explains how to create a bootloader, how to create a main program to go with the bootloader and how to use this bootloader to perform software updates.

### Arm Mbed OS managed bootloader

The tools of Arm Mbed OS know how to manage some bootloader projects. The tools can manage bootloader projects where the bootloader comes before the application in ROM and the application starts immediately after the bootloader. If your bootloader does not meet both of these requirements, then please read the [unmanaged bootloader section](#unmanaged-bootloader). A managed bootloader project automatically merges the bootloader image with the application image as part of the application image build process.

#### Creating the bootloader

Creating a bootloader is similar to creating a regular application. The only additional step you need is to specify the size of the bootloader as a target override in `mbed_app.json` in the target field `target.restrict_size`:

```
"target_overrides": {
    ...
    "<TARGET_NAME>": {
        "target.restrict_size": "0x20000"
    },
    ...
```

Adding this field:

* Restricts the bootloader code from growing larger than the specified size.
* Pads the output image to exactly the size specified.
* Defines the symbols `APPLICATION_ADDR`, `APPLICATION_SIZE`, `POST_APPLICATION_ADDR`, `POST_APPLICATION_SIZE`.

It produces the following ROM layout:

```
|-------------------|   POST_APPLICATION_ADDR + POST_APPLICATION_SIZE == End of ROM
|                   |
...
|                   |
|                   |
|     Reserved      |
|                   |
+-------------------+   POST_APPLICATION_ADDR == APPLICATION_ADDR + APPLICATION_SIZE
|                   |
|    Application    |
| (is a bootloader) |
|                   |
+-------------------+   APPLICATION_ADDR == Start of ROM
```

When the bootloader finishes its work, it needs to start the main program. To do this, the bootloader must flush or power down any external components it is using, such as filesystems or socket connections. After the bootloader powers down these components, it can start the main program by making a call to the function `mbed_start_application(uintptr_t address)` and passing in the base address of the next image to start. For Arm Mbed OS applications, the main program starts immediately after the bootloader, so you can use the symbol `POST_APPLICATION_ADDR` as its starting address.

Call the bootloader to start the main program:

```
mbed_start_application(POST_APPLICATION_ADDR);
```

For an example showing how to create a bootloader, see the [`mbed-os-example-bootloader`](https://github.com/armmbed/mbed-os-example-bootloader) repository.

#### Creating the main program

To create an application using a bootloader, you must first have created the bootloader binary and added it to the current project. You must then specify the bootloader image in `mbed_app.json` in the `target_override` section:

```
"target_overrides": {
    ...
    "<TARGET_NAME>": {
        "target.bootloader_img": "bootloader/my_bootloader.bin"
    },
    ...
```

Adding this field has following effects:

* When a build occurs, the application builds for the address immediately after the bootloader. The build system does this automatically by defining the symbols `MBED_APP_START` and `MBED_APP_SIZE` in the linker script (`.sct`, `.ld` or `.icf`).
* At the end of building, the build image is automatically combined with the bootloader to create the final image.

    <span class="notes">**Note:** When building offline, the original uncombined image is in the same directory `<project-name>_application.bin`.</span>

* It defines the symbols `APPLICATION_ADDR`, `APPLICATION_SIZE`, `BOOTLOADER_ADDR` and `BOOTLOADER_SIZE`.

It produces the following ROM layout:

```
|-------------------|   APPLICATION_ADDR + APPLICATION_SIZE == End of ROM
|                   |
...
|                   |
|    Application    |
|  (main program )  |
|                   |
+-------------------+   APPLICATION_ADDR == BOOTLOADER_ADDR + BOOTLOADER_SIZE
|                   |
|    Bootloader     |
|(my_bootloader.bin)|
|                   |
+-------------------+   BOOTLOADER_ADDR == Start of ROM
```

### Unmanaged bootloader

You want to have an unmanaged bootloader when your bootloader's requirements conflict with the requirements of the managed bootloader. You need an unmanaged bootloader when your bootloader does not come before your application in ROM or your application does not start immediately after your bootloader. Unlike a managed bootloader, an unmanaged bootloader does not automatically merge the bootloader image with the application image after building the application. We expect users of an unmanaged bootloader build to construct their own set of scripts built atop the `mbed compile` primitive to perform bootloader and application merging.

An unmanaged bootloader build is a method for controlling the link location of a program within Mbed OS. There are two configuration options available for changing the link location: `target.mbed_app_start` and `target.mbed_app_size`.

#### `target.mbed_app_start`

The configuration option `target.mbed_app_start` sets the starting address of the linker script by defining the `MBED_APP_START` macro for the linker script. You may only define this configuration option within the `target_overrides` section of an Mbed application configuration, and you may not define it for the metatarget `*`. When you do not define this configuration option, it defaults to the start of a target's ROM. This configuration option must be an address within ROM.

#### `target.mbed_app_size`

The configuration option `target.mbed_app_size` defines the size of an application image in ROM by defining the `MBED_APP_SIZE` macro for the linker script. You may only define this configuration option on a per-target basis defined within the `target_overrides` section of an Mbed application configuration, and you may not define it for the metatarget `*`. When you do not define this configuration option, it defaults to the remaining ROM. The Mbed OS tools calculate the remaining ROM by subtracting the image's offset into ROM from the total size of ROM. Together with `target.mbed_app_start`, these configuration options define a continuous region of memory that an image may use. The tools verify that this region of memory is in ROM, but the tools do not perform any other checks for consistency or validity.
