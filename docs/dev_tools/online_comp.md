# mbed Online Compiler

The online compiler enables you to either write your code from scratch or import an existing project and modify it to suit your needs. The only thing you need is [an mbed developer account](https://developer.mbed.org/account/signup/).

The compiler is always available on [https://developer.mbed.org/compiler/](https://developer.mbed.org/compiler/).

## Video summary

## Importing code to the compiler

There are two methods of importing the code into the online compiler: directly from a program presented on the site, or using the compilerâ€™s Import button:

1. Directly from the site: wherever you see a program on the site, you should see an Import button:
	
	<span class="images">![](Images/import_button_site.png)<span>Most code snippets on the site can be directly imported</span></span>

	Clicking that button will take you to the compiler; you can then give the program a new name and import it to your workspace:

	<span class="images">![](Images/import_popup.png)<span>Importing to the mbed Online Compiler</span></span>


1. The compiler's Import button: click the **Import** button in the compiler to open the Import Wizard:

	<span class="images">![](Images/import_button_comp.png)<span>Triggering the Import Wizard from within the mbed Online Compiler</span></span>

	You can search for a program by name, or perform an empty search to show all available programs:

	<span class="images">![](Images/all_programs.png)<span>The applications list</span></span>

	Double click a program to import it.

## Creating a new program 

1. From the **New** menu, select **Program**:

1. The **Create new program** pop-up opens.
	1. Select your platform (board). 
	1. You can create from an existing template, or from an empty program.
	1. Enter a unique name.

1. Create a ``main.cpp`` file in your program:
	1. Right click on the program and select **New File...**. The **Create new file** popup opens.

	1. Enter ``main.cpp`` as the file name.

1. Import the mbed OS library so you can build your program with the mbed OS code base:
	1. Click **Import**. The Import Wizard opens.
	1. Go to the Libraries tab and search for "mbed", or perform an empty search to show all libraries:

	1. Double click on "mbed" to import it. The library is added to your program.

		<span class="images">![](Images/with_mbed.png)<span>mbed OS is now in the workspace</span></span>

## Getting your program on your board

The mbed Online Compiler builds a file that can run on your board. All you need to do is:

1. Select the correct board.
1. Compile the code and download the compiled file.
1. Copy the file to your board.

### Selecting your board

mbed programs can be built to run on multiple boards. The hard work is done behind the scenes, by mbed OS itself. All you need to do is tell the mbed Online Compiler which board you're building for.

To select a board as the build target:

1. The compiler shows the current build board's name on the upper right corner:

	<span class="images">![](Images/show_board.png)<span>Showing current board. Click the board to open the full list</span></span>

1. Click the name of the board you need:

	<span class="images">![](Images/select_board.png)<span>Click a board to set it as the compilation board</span></span>

	If the board isn't already on your list, go to the board's page on mbed.com and click the **Add to your mbed Compiler** button:

	<span class="images">![](Images/add_board.png)<span>Adding a board to the mbed Online Compiler list</span></span>

###  Compile and download

The **Compile** menu offers five options:

1. **Compile:** builds your code and downloads a binary file. Current program only.
1. **Compile All:** same as *compile*, but for all programs.
1. **Build Only:** compiles your code but doesn't download the result.
1. **Compile Macros:** defines additional macros at compile time.
1. **Update Docs**: see the [guide for documenting APIs](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os-api-reference/en/5.1/APIs/API_Documentation/).

### Copying the file to the board

<span class="notes">**Note:** If you're working on Windows, you might need to install a driver to allow you to copy to your board. Please see the [Windows Serial Driver section](../getting_started/what_need.md#windows-serial-driver).</span>

Your board should appear on your computer as removable storage. To run your program on the board, simply drag and drop the file you downloaded in the previous section. 

<span class="images">![](Images/device_on_mac.png)<span>The device appears as removable storage, under the name MBED</span></span>
