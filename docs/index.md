# Introduction to the mbed OS 5 Handbook

Welcome to the mbed OS 5 handbook. 

If youâ€™re an experienced mbed applications developer, you might want to dive straight into the [API References](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os-api-reference/en/), or take a look at our [development tools documentation](dev_tools/options.md).

If you're new to all this, continue reading.

## What do you do with mbed OS?

mbed OS lets you write applications that run on embedded devices, by providing the layer that interprets your application's code in a way the hardware can understand.

Your application code - written in C++ - uses the *application programing interfaces* (APIs) presented by mbed OS to receive information from the hardware and send instructions to it. This means that a lot of the challenges in getting started with microcontrollers or integrating large amounts of software is already taken care of. 

## Where to start

The easiest way to work with mbed OS is using one of our development tools. We've set up an example, [Blinky](getting_started/first_program.md), that you can try on each of the tools.

## Development tools

* Our offline development tool is the [mbed CLI](dev_tools/cli.md), a command line tool. This requires having a toolchain installed on your computer. 
* The [mbed Online Compiler](dev_tools/online_comp.md) lets you write and build applications using just a web browser and USB connection.
* If you're working with third party tools, we have [exporting instructions for the most popular ones](dev_tools/third_party.md).

## How to continue

When you've tried our example and picked your work environment, it's time to learn how mbed OS and its tools enable the features your application needs:

* You can read [the general introduction to the APIs](APIs/intro.md), or jump straight to the [API References](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os-api-reference/en/).

* Try one of the [advanced tutorials](advanced/intro.md), which cover concepts like debugging and version control.

* We have a [forum](https://forums.mbed.com/) for questions and advice.
