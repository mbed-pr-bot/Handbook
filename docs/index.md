# Introduction to the mbed OS 5 Handbook

Welcome to the mbed OS 5 handbook. 

If youâ€™re an experienced mbed applications developer, you might want to dive straight into the [API References](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os-api-reference/en/) or look at our [development tools documentation](dev_tools/options.md).

If you're new to all this, continue reading.

## Developing applications on top of mbed OS

mbed OS lets you write applications that run on embedded devices, by providing the layer that interprets your application's code in a way the hardware can understand.

Your application code is written in C++. It uses the *application programming interfaces* (APIs) that mbed OS provides. These APIs allow your code to work on different microcontrollers in a uniform way. This reduces a lot of the challenges in getting started with microcontrollers and integrating large amounts of software. 

### Where to start

<span class="tips">If you're working on Windows, you might need to [install a serial driver](getting_started/what_need.md#windows-serial-driver).</span>

The easiest way to work with mbed OS is using one of our development tools. We've set up an example, [Blinky](getting_started/first_program.md), that you can try on each of the tools. It will teach you to build and run an application on your board.

When you know how to build an existing application, it's time to learn [how to write your own applications](APIs/intro.md).

### Development tools

* Our offline development tool is the [mbed CLI](dev_tools/cli.md), a command-line tool. This requires having a toolchain installed on your computer. 
* The [mbed Online Compiler](dev_tools/online_comp.md) lets you write and build applications using just a web browser and USB connection.
* If you're working with third party tools, look at [exporting instructions for the most popular ones](dev_tools/third_party.md).

### Communicating with and monitoring your board

You can monitor and control an mbed board [to help you debug and test your applications](getting_started/mbed_interface.md).

<span class="tips">**Tip:** You can learn more about debugging [here](advanced/debugging.md).</span>

### How to continue

When you've started writing applications using your selected development tool:

* Learn about [collaborative work and version control](collab/collab_intro.md).

* Try one of the [advanced tutorials](advanced/intro.md), which cover concepts such as debugging and memory trace.

* We have a [forum](https://forums.mbed.com/) for questions and advice.

## Contributing to mbed OS

If you want to contribute to the mbed OS codebase, please see [the contribution section](cont/contributing.md).

The current version of mbed OS 5 is 5.4.0. It is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/releases/tag/mbed-os-5.4.0).

## Porting to mbed OS

Our full porting guide is still being written. For now, we have:

* A high-level [porting guide](advanced/porting_guide.md).
* Porting [from mbed OS 3 to mbed OS 5](advanced/MINAR_migration.md) (focusing on MINAR).
* Porting [mbed TLS](advanced/tls_porting.md).
