# Blinky on mbed CLI

## Quick start video

<span class="tips">**Tip:** the video assumes you've already [installed mbed CLI](#installing-mbed-cli-and-a-toolchain).

## Blinky's code

```c++
#include "mbed.h"
#include "rtos.h"

DigitalOut led1(LED1);

// main() runs in its own thread in the OS
// (note the calls to Thread::wait below for delays)
int main() {
    while (true) {
        led1 = !led1;
        Thread::wait(500);
    }
}

```

## Installing mbed CLI and a toolchain

mbed CLI is an offline tool, meaning you'll have to install it before you can work. You will also need to install a toolchain. Please follow the installation instructions on the [mbed CLI page](../dev_tools/cli.md), and come back here when you're done.

## Setting context

Whenever you work with mbed CLI, you need to navigate your command-line terminal to the directory it which you want to work. For example, if your program is in a folder called ``my_program``:

```
cd my_program
mbed <commands>
```

## Getting Blinky

mbed CLI can import Blinky, along with the mbed OS codebase. The import process creates a new directory as a subdirectory of you current context (as explained above). 

To import Blinky, from the command line:

1. Navigate to a directory of your choice. We're navigating to our development directory:

    ``cd dev_directory``

1. Import the example:

    ```
    mbed import mbed-os-example-blinky
    cd mbed-os-example-blinky
    ```
    **Tip:** ``import`` requires a full URL to Mercurial or GitHub. If you don't enter a full URL, mbed CLI prefixes your snippet with ``https://github.com/ARMmbed/``. We took advantage of this feature in our example; ``import mbed-os-example-blinky`` is interpreted as ``https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-example-blinky``.

Blinky is now under ``dev_directory`` > `` mbed-os-example-blinky``. You can look at ``main.cpp`` to familiarize yourself with the code.

## Compiling

Invoke `mbed compile`, specifying:

* Your board: ``-m <board_name>``
* Your toolchain ``-t <GCC_ARM`, `ARM` or `IAR`>``.

For example, for the board K64F and the ARM Compiler 5:

```
mbed compile -m K64F -t ARM
```

Your PC may take a few minutes to compile your code. At the end you should get the following result:

```

The program file, ``mbed-os-example-blinky.bin``, is under your ``build\K64F\ARM\`` folder.

## Programming your board

mbed enabled boards are programable by drag and drop over a USB connection.

1. Connect your mbed board to the computer over USB.
1. Copy the binary file to the board. In the example above, the file is ``mbed-os-example-blinky.bin``, and it's under the ``build\K64F\ARM\`` folder.
1. Press the reset button to start the program.

You should see the LED of your board turning on and off.
